<p style="line-height:1.2"><img src="https://huffordlab.github.io/pictures/Matt.jpg" align="right"><font size="3"><b>Matthew Hufford, Associate Professor</b>: <br>
Matt joined the faculty of the Ecology, Evolution, & Organismal Biology Department at Iowa State University in Fall of 2013. Prior to this, Matt worked as a postdoctoral scholar with Jeff Ross-Ibarra at the University of California, Davis and completed his graduate training, also at UC Davis, under the instruction of Paul Gepts. Matt is a <i>bona fide</i> maize geek, is fascinated by crop evolution and ecology, and has a nasty marathoning habit.</font></p>


<p style="line-height:1.2"><img src="https://huffordlab.github.io/pictures/Michael.jpg" align="left"><font size="3"><b>Michael Syring, Lab Manager</b>: <br>
Michael comes to the maize genomics world from a diverse research background in human genetics, proteomics, and personalized medicine. With a degree in Biotechnology/Chemistry from the University of Northern Iowa, Michael will assist on current research projects, while managing students and day-to-day laboratory activities. Michael's interests in the lab also extend to bioinformatics and data analysis. Outside the lab Michael enjoys rock climbing, running, and baseball, and doing all these activities with his wife and kids.</font></p>

<p style="line-height:1.2"><img src="https://huffordlab.github.io/pictures/Shujun.jpg" align="right"><font size="3"><b>Shujun Ou, Postdoctoral Scholar</b>: <br> Shujun joined the Hufford lab in the Spring of 2019. He obtained a PhD in Plant Genetics and Evolution from Michigan State University under the instruction of Ning Jiang. Shujun is interested in transposable elements and population genetics. He is working to understand the functional and adaptive significance of TEs during the evolution of plants, primarily in crop species. Rice and maize are his favorite systems. Shujun's additional interests include (ice-)fishing, volleyball, badminton, outdoor activities, and cooking.</font></p>
