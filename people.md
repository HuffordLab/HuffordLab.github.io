<p style="line-height:1.2"><b>Matthew Hufford, Associate Professor</b>: <br>
<img src="https://huffordlab.github.io/pictures/Matt.jpg" align="right"><font size="3">Matt joined the faculty of the Ecology, Evolution, & Organismal Biology Department at Iowa State University in Fall of 2013. Prior to this, Matt worked as a postdoctoral scholar with Jeff Ross-Ibarra at the University of California, Davis and completed his graduate training, also at UC Davis, under the instruction of Paul Gepts. Matt is a bona fide maize geek, is fascinated by crop evolution and ecology, and has a nasty marathoning habit.</font></p>
