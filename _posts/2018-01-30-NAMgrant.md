The National Science Foundation has funded us, in collaboration with Kelly Dawe at the University of Georgia and Doreen Ware at Cold Spring Harbor, to assemble the 26 founder inbred lines of the Maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) Population. This will be an excellent resource for the maize community and will provide our group with an opportunity to study the genetic basis of tropical and temperate adaptation in maize.
