Samantha Snodgrass, a PhD student in the Hufford Lab, was awarded a Graduate Research Fellowship grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF GRFP), which supports outstanding graduate students in STEM-related programs. Her proposal focused on using emerging genomic resources and tools to test classical genetics models of heterosis in maize. Specifically she plans to use the NAM reference genomes in combination with a diallel population of hybrids to identify single parent expression genes and characterize the underlying sequence variants that may cause these expression patterns.
