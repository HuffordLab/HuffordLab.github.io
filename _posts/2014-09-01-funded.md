Our proposal to study highland adaptation in maize was funded by NSF-CNIC! Weâ€™ll be working with collaborators at UC Davis, USDA-ARS, University of Missouri, and Langebio in Mexico to develop mapping populations to study the genetic architecture of highland adaptation traits and to conduct a phenotyping workshop in Mexico in 2015.
