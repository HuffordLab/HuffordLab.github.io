C.A.M.P. is a journal club during which we end our week with some libations and erudite discussion. Each Friday, the Hufford Lab and “camp”adres convene at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stomping-Grounds-107335579324901/">Stomping Grounds</a> @ 4:00pm for discussion of journal articles that attract our fancy. No tents or flashlights required.
